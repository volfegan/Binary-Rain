![alt tag](BinaryRain.jpg)

A modified version of the Digital Rain sequence from the Matrix showing binary streams rainning and bytes accessing each value. The code is a different version of emilyxxie/green_rain demonstrated on [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1TQCi9axzg) YouTube channel.

This animation is going to be on http://volfeganbox.byethost14.com/

The directory [BinaryRain-InstanceMode] is the same program, but written in instance mode (aka -namespacing-). So if you need to use various p5 projects on the same sketch.js file, instance Mode is what you need.
